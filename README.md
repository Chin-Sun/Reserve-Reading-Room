# Textbook Sharing Room
## Introduction
The system provides a platform for users to reserve reading rooms in the library. To make a reservation, users are required to specify the textbook and course number they will be using. Each reading room has a maximum capacity of ten students. The system functions as follows:

1. Student Login: Students log into the system using their credentials.  
2. Check Room Availability: Students can check if a reading room is already booked for their class during their preferred time slot. They can search for availability based on the course number or the textbook.  
3. Room Capacity: If a reading room is available, the student needs to ensure that it can accommodate them based on its maximum capacity.  
4. Reservation: If an appropriate reading room is available, the student can reserve it. However, if there are no suitable rooms or all rooms are already booked, the student has the option to reserve a new reading room and order the required textbook from the library.  
5. Avoid Duplicate Reservations: A student cannot reserve multiple reading rooms for the same course at the same time. However, friends can be added to a reservation by allowing their IDs to be included.  
6. Time Slots: The system offers a minimum time slot of 1 hour, and users can book the reading room for a maximum of 5 hours.  
7. Maximum Reading Rooms: The maximum number of reading rooms available for a particular course is determined by the number of students registered for that course. This information is retrieved from the registration system.  
8. Instructor Access: The course instructor has access to the booking logs, which allow them to see which students are studying together.
